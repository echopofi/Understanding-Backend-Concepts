A simple Python script demonstrating secure password hashing using **bcrypt** and professional logging practices.

## Features

- Secure password hashing with **bcrypt** (random salt, 12 rounds)
- Proper verification of passwords
- Structured logging to both **console** and **file**
- Uses advanced logging handlers (console + file)
- Clean separation of user output (`print`) and developer logs (`logger`)
- Never logs raw passwords (security best practice)

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- bcrypt library

Install dependency:
```bash
pip install bcrypt
